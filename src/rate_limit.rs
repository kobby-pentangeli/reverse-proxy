//! Per-IP rate limiting using the GCRA (Generic Cell Rate Algorithm).
//!
//! Wraps the [`governor`] crate's keyed rate limiter to enforce a configurable
//! requests-per-second limit per client IP address. Each unique IP gets its
//! own token bucket with the configured sustained rate and burst capacity.
//!
//! Stale entries for IPs that have not been seen recently are periodically
//! pruned via [`IpRateLimiter::retain_recent`], which should be called from
//! a background task to prevent unbounded memory growth under high-cardinality
//! traffic.
